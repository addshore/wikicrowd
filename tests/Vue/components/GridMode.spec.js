// Using Jest/Vitest-like syntax for description

// --- Mocking Setup ---
// Global fetch mock
const mockFetch = vi.fn();
global.fetch = mockFetch;

// Mock toastStore
const mockAddToast = vi.fn();
vi.mock('../../../resources/js/toastStore', () => ({
  toastStore: {
    addToast: mockAddToast,
    toasts: [], // Provide a default empty array for the computed property in component
  },
  // If useToast is exported and used, mock it too
  // useToast: () => ({ addToast: mockAddToast, toasts: [] })
}));

// Mock depictsUtils (if needed for broader tests, less critical for answer logic)
vi.mock('../../../resources/js/components/depictsUtils', () => ({
  fetchSubclassesAndInstances: vi.fn(),
  fetchDepictsForMediaInfoIds: vi.fn(),
}));

// Mock console.error and console.warn if necessary to ensure they are not called unexpectedly
// or to verify specific calls if toasts don't replace all of them.
// console.error = vi.fn();
// console.warn = vi.fn();


// --- Vue Test Utils and Component Import ---
// import { shallowMount, mount } from '@vue/test-utils'; // Or from 'vitest-vue-plugin' etc.
// import GridMode from '../../../resources/js/components/GridMode.vue';

// Helper function to create a default props set
const createProps = (customProps = {}) => ({
  manualCategory: '',
  manualQid: '',

// Note: Actual test running would require a test runner (Jest or Vitest)
// and proper setup for Vue Test Utils, including mounting the component,
// interacting with its methods/DOM, and using await for async operations.
// The vi.fn() and vi.mock() are placeholders for Vitest's mocking API.
// For Jest, it would be jest.fn() and jest.mock().
// The component instance would be accessed via wrapper = mount(GridMode, { props: ... })
// and then wrapper.vm.methodToTest() or await wrapper.vm.methodToTest().
// Assertions on component data would be expect(wrapper.vm.someData).toEqual(...).
// This skeleton focuses on the structure and test case descriptions.
